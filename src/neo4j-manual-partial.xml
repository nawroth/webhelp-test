<title>Preface</title>
<simpara>This is the reference manual for Neo4j version 1.9-SNAPSHOT, authored by the Neo4j Team.</simpara>
<simpara>The main parts of the manual are:</simpara>
<simpara>The material is practical, technical, and focused on answering specific questions.
It addresses how things work, what to do and what to avoid to successfully run Neo4j in a production environment.</simpara>
<simpara>The goal is to be thumb-through and rule-of-thumb friendly.</simpara>
<simpara>Each section should stand on its own, so you can hop right to whatever interests you.
When possible, the sections distill &#8220;rules of thumb&#8221; which you can keep in mind whenever you wander out of the house without this manual in your back pocket.</simpara>
<simpara>The included code examples are executed when Neo4j is built and tested.
Also, the REST API request and response examples are captured from real interaction with a Neo4j server.
Thus, the examples are always in sync with how Neo4j actually works.</simpara>
<simpara><emphasis>Who should read this?</emphasis></simpara>
<simpara>The topics should be relevant to architects, administrators, developers and operations personnel.</simpara>

<title>Introduction</title>
<partintro>
<simpara>This part gives a bird&#8217;s eye view of what a graph database is, and then outlines some specifics of Neo4j.</simpara>

<chapter id="introduction-highlights">
<title>Neo4j Highlights</title>
<simpara>As a robust, scalable and high-performance database, Neo4j is suitable for full enterprise deployment or a subset of the full server can be used in lightweight projects.</simpara>
<simpara>It features:</simpara>
<itemizedlist>
<listitem>
<simpara>
true ACID transactions,
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
high availability,
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
scales to billions of nodes and relationships,
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
high speed querying through traversals,
</simpara>
</listitem>
<listitem>
<simpara>
declarative graph query language.
</simpara>
</listitem>
</itemizedlist>
<simpara>Proper ACID behavior is the foundation of data reliability.
Neo4j enforces that all operations that modify data occur within a transaction, guaranteeing consistent data.
This robustness extends from single instance embedded graphs to multi-server high availability installations.
For details, see transactions.</simpara>
<simpara>Reliable graph storage can easily be added to any application.
A graph can scale in size and complexity as the application evolves, with little impact on performance.
Whether starting new development, or augmenting existing functionality, Neo4j is only limited by physical hardware.</simpara>
<simpara>A single server instance can handle a graph of billions of nodes and relationships.
When data throughput is insufficient, the graph database can be distributed among multiple servers in a high availability configuration.
See HA to learn more.</simpara>
<simpara>The graph database storage shines when storing richly-connected data.
Querying is performed through traversals, which can perform millions of traversal steps per second.
A traversal step resembles a <emphasis>join</emphasis> in a RDBMS.</simpara>
